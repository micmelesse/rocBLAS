AMD BLIS - Release Notes - version 2.0
--------------------------------------------

BLIS is a portable software framework for instantiating high-performance 
BLAS-like dense linear algebra libraries. The framework was designed to isolate 
essential kernels of computation that, when optimized, enable optimized 
implementations of most of its commonly used and computationally intensive 
operations. Some of these essential kernels have been optimized for the AMD 
EPYC processor family by AMD and others. The optimizations are done for single 
and double precision routines.  

Highlights of AMD BLIS 2.0
---------------------------
-	Improved BLIS performance on AMD Rome based architecture including 
    Level1 and Level2 BLAS Performances improvements
-	Framework changes to better handle memory management
-	Improved DGEMM performance
-	Improved TRSM performance for small problem sizes for AMD Naples and Rome 
    based architectures
-	BLIS build now supports both zen and zen2 configurations for AMD Naples and
    ROME architectures respectively

AMD BLIS 2.0 is validated on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS and CentOS 7.6 with GCC 7.3. 

The package contains BLIS Library binaries which includes optimizations for 
the AMD EPYC processor family, header files and examples.
